<br>

I am the Director of AI & Data Science Partnerships at [Fred Hutch Cancer Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html){:target="_blank"} and Director of the [Cancer AI Alliance (CAIA)](https://www.canceralliance.ai/){:target="_blank"} Strategic Coordinating Center. 
I am a data scientist, strategist, and open knowledge advocate who has spent my career leading large-scale initiatives that operate at the intersection of data, technology, and biomedical research. 

I have been invited to share my experiences as an advisor to organizations such as the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the International Data Forum.
Additionally, I was recognized by the Mozilla Foundation as one of the “[50 People Who Are Making the Internet a Better Place](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/guiding-change-towards-agency-41a657523ac3){:target="_blank"}” and received the [2020 Symbiont Award](https://researchsymbionts.org/){:target="_blank"} for sustained excellence in scientific data sharing.

Previously, I worked as a Data Strategy Consultant working on assignment for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation where I lead the Analytics Unit for their [DAC program](https://dac-trials.org/){:target="_blank"} and spent 11 years with [Sage Bionetworks](http://www.sagebionetworks.org){:target="_blank"} most recently serving as Chief of Staff and leading Outreach and Strategic Development on behalf of the Executive Leadership Team. 
And if we go in the wayback machine, I worked as a statistician at the [Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/){:target="_blank"} for seven years where I focused on colorectal cancer, clinical trials, and high-throughput genomics.

I enjoy solving complex, interdisciplinary problems with passionate people and for mission-driven organizations.
