<br>

I am a passionate data scientist, strategist, and open knowledge advocate working at the intersection of data, technology, and biomedical research.
This work is centered on creating a more just and equitable data ecosystem primarily through the development and implementation of ethical data practices across a wide range of stakeholders and sectors. 
I am currently Director of AI & Data Science Partnerships at [Fred Hutch Cancer Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html){:target="_blank"} and Founding Executive Director of the Strategic Coordinating Center for the [Cancer AI Alliance](https://www.canceralliance.ai/){:target="_blank"}. 

I have been invited to share my experiences as an advisor to organizations such as the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the International Data Forum.
Additionally, I was recognized by the Mozilla Foundation as one of the “[50 People Who Are Making the Internet a Better Place](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/guiding-change-towards-agency-41a657523ac3){:target="_blank"}” and received the [2020 Symbiont Award](https://researchsymbionts.org/){:target="_blank"} for sustained excellence in scientific data sharing.

Previously, I worked as a Data Strategy Consultant working on assignment for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation where I lead the Analytics Unit for their [DAC program](https://dac-trials.org/){:target="_blank"} and spent 11 years with [Sage Bionetworks](http://www.sagebionetworks.org){:target="_blank"} most recently serving as Chief of Staff and leading Outreach and Strategic Development on behalf of the Executive Leadership Team. 
And if we go in the wayback machine, I worked as a statistician at the [Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/){:target="_blank"} for seven years where I focused on colorectal cancer, clinical trials, and high-throughput genomics.

I enjoy solving complex, interdisciplinary problems with passionate people and for mission-driven organizations.
