### professional life
I am a passionate scientist, strategist, and open knowledge advocate working at the intersection of data, technology, and governance. 
This work is centered on creating a more just and equitable data ecosystem primarily through the development and implementation of ethical data practices across a wide range of stakeholders and sectors. 
I have been invited to share my experiences as an advisor to organizations such as the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the International Data Forum.
Additionally, I was recognized by the Mozilla Foundation as one of the “[50 People Who Are Making the Internet a Better Place](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/guiding-change-towards-agency-41a657523ac3){:target="_blank"}” and received the [2020 Symbiont Award](https://researchsymbionts.org/){:target="_blank"} for sustained excellence in scientific data sharing.
I enjoy solving complex, interdisciplinary problems with passionate people and for mission-driven organizations.

Currently, I am a Data Strategy Consultant working on assignment for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and serve as the Analytics Unit Lead for their [DAC program](https://dac-trials.tghn.org/){:target="_blank"}. 
Prior to my consulting role(s), I spent 11 years with [Sage Bionetworks](http://www.sagebase.org){:target="_blank"} most recently serving as Chief of Staff and leading Outreach and Strategic Development on behalf of the Executive Leadership Team. 
And if we go in the way-back machine, I worked as a statistician at the [Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/){:target="_blank"} for seven years where I focused on colorectal cancer, clinical trials, and high-throughput genomics.

### personal life
When not consumed by the 'professional life' above, I enjoy traveling, spending time with family and friends, spinning vinyl, playing cards, golfing, drinking good coffee or wine (depending on the hour of the day), and grilling. 
Lots of grilling.
I live in Seattle, WA and am lucky to have three fruit trees which keep me busy in the summer months. 
I am a Minnesota native, and am proud of my hearty heritage (see below).
